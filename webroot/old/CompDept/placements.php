        <h1>Lets Discuss Placements..</h1>
        <p>On all our undergraduate computing courses you have the opportunity to spend your third year on a 48-week paid internship in a company.</p>

        <p>Employers understand the value of this kind of experience - and so do we.</p>

        <p>Work placements are a real advantage. You develop your confidence and practical skills, get work experience to go on your CV, and have brilliant opportunities to network with employers.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>We organise and help you apply for these placements. In the Department of Computing we have longstanding relationships with many well-known international companies and other smaller organisations throughout the UK who return to us for students every year.</p>
